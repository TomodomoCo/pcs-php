# PCS PHP

A simple PHP client for Publisher's Creative System's [SOAP API](http://pcspublink.com/technology-and-tools/api-and-xml-web-services/).

## Usage

The client must be installed with Composer, as a manual VCS repository (it is not currently available in Packagist).

To set up the client:

```php
// Create a new instance of the API client with your pubcode and API password
$pcs = new PCS('PUBCODE', 'API password');
```

To check if a user is active:

```php
$status = $pcs->isUserActive('user@email.com', 'secret password');
// returns true or false
```
